# [Sentiment Analysis Prediction using NN and LSTM Project]

### From Binar Academy Data Science Batch 1 Platinum Challenge

The goal from this challenge is to *made an API to analyse text sentiment and made a data analytics report based on the predicted sentiment*

What included in this resporitory:
- Data cleansing with **Pandas** and **RegEx**,
- Feature extraction, NN training, and Model Evaluation for NN and LSTM with **Sklearn**,
- Data training for LSTM with **Tensorflow**,
- Model evaluation visualisation of NN and LSTM with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**,
- API for sentiment prediction with NN and LSTM with **Flask** and **Swagger UI**
